# TestingPlayground

Welcome to **TestingPlayground**! This repository is dedicated to showcasing testing strategies and examples for a range of web development technologies. We begin with **React Testing** using **Vitest** and plan to expand to other front-end frameworks like Vue, as well as back-end testing with **Laravel** and **PHPUnit**. Whether you're working on the client side or the server side, this repository aims to provide valuable testing examples to help ensure your applications are robust and reliable.

# Structure
## React Testing Submodule

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-^5.2.2-yellow)
![Vitest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vitest-^2.0.5-purple)
![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/Playwright-^1.48.2-green)

The `react-testing` submodule within the `testing-playground` repository is dedicated to providing TypeScript test cases and examples specifically for testing React applications. This submodule utilizes the powerful Vitest testing framework along with Playwright, offering a comprehensive suite that demonstrates best practices and essential techniques for testing different aspects of React components and functionality. With Vitest and Playwright, the submodule covers both unit and end-to-end testing scenarios, making it a valuable resource for testing modern React applications.

## Laravel Testing Submodule

![PHPUnit](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHPUnit-^10.5.36-purple)
![Dusk](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dusk-^8.2.10-green)

The `laravel-testing` submodule within the `testing-playground` repository focuses on providing test cases and examples specifically for testing Laravel applications. These test cases are derived from my technical tests completed in 2022 and demonstrate effective strategies for testing various Laravel features and components. This submodule utilizes:

- **PHPUnit** for backend and functional testing
- **Laravel Dusk** for browser-based testing

Together, these tools showcase a robust approach to testing in a Laravel environment, covering both backend logic and user interface interactions.

## Vue Testing Submodule
![Laravel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Laravel-^11.29.0-blue)
![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-^3.5.7-yellow)
![Vitest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vitest-^3.5.7-purple)
![Playwright](https://img.shields.io/badge/Playwright-^1.48.2-green)

The `vue-testing` submodule within the `testing-playground` repository is dedicated to demonstrating Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices for Vue.js applications, specifically through building a **To-Do app**. This submodule employs multiple testing frameworks to ensure a comprehensive testing approach:

- **Vitest** for unit and component testing of Vue components
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing across all modern browsers
- **PHPUnit** for backend testing within the Laravel environment

Together, these frameworks enable a robust test-first workflow that covers frontend and backend aspects of the To-Do app.

# Next Testing
