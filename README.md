# TestingPlayground

Welcome to **TestingPlayground**! This repository is dedicated to showcasing testing strategies and examples for a range of web development technologies. We begin with **React Testing** using **Vitest** and plan to expand to other front-end frameworks like Vue, as well as back-end testing with **Laravel** and **PHPUnit**. Whether you're working on the client side or the server side, this repository aims to provide valuable testing examples to help ensure your applications are robust and reliable.

## Structure

- `react-testing/` - Contains test cases and examples for testing React applications using Vitest.
  
Just focuses on a specific aspect of React testing, such as testing components and other essential functionalities.

More testing examples for other frameworks and libraries will be added in the future as the repository grows.
